"""``.env`` files read as data, in the line format the common loaders agree on.

python-dotenv, Node's dotenv (and so Vite) and Docker Compose all accept ``KEY=value``,
an ``export`` prefix, spaces around ``=``, ``#`` comments, single, double and backtick
quotes, and quoted values over several lines. Other lines are ignored, as they are.

Nothing is expanded or run: ``${VAR}`` stays in the value and the entry is marked as a
*reference*, so a collector never treats ``${DATA_ROOT}/uploads`` as a literal path. An
unquoted ``#`` starts a comment only after a space or tab, as in python-dotenv and
Compose; Node's dotenv also cuts ``https://x/#a`` there, so such values are rare in
practice.
